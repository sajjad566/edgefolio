# *Web Developer* <span>&</span> *UI/UX Designer*

New things come out every day and being a developer/designer means you must seek to improve what you already know. I'm happy to be passionate about designing & developing and I display this passion in every project I take.

```js {2-4} showLineNumbers
const services = [
  'UI/UX Design'
  'Full Stack Development'
  'CMS Development'
]
if (have_a_project) navigate('/contact')
```
